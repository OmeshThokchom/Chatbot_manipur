2025-10-31 04:02:19,372 - INFO - Sending response: Use the Colab helper library:

```python
from google.colab import files
files.download('your_file.ext')   # single file
# or zip multiple files first, then download the zip
```

🗂️ After the cell runs, a download link pops up and the file lands in your local *Downloads* folder. 🚀

| 2 | **Mount Google Drive** | `from google.colab import drive; drive.mount('/content/drive')` then copy from `/content/drive/MyDrive/` |
| 3 | **`wget`/`curl` to a public URL** | `!wget https://example.com/file -O local_name` (then download via method 1) |
| 4 | **Zip & download** | `!zip -r archive.zip folder/ && from google.colab import files; files.download('archive.zip')` |
| 5 | **Use PyDrive API** | Set up PyDrive, then `file.GetContentFile('filename')` to save locally.
